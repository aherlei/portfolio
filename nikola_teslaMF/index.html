                <h1>Who I am</h1>
                <p>
                    Was a Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and futurist. He is best-known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla first studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree. He then gaining practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884 he emigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His AC induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    After Wardenclyffe, Tesla experimented with a series of inventions in the 1910s and 1920s with varying degrees of success. Having spent most of his money, Tesla lived in a series of New York hotels, leaving behind unpaid bills. He died in New York City in January 1943.[8] Tesla's work fell into relative obscurity following his death, until 1960, when the General Conference on Weights and Measures named the International System of Units (SI) measurement of magnetic flux density the tesla in his honor. There has been a resurgence in popular interest in Tesla since the 1990s.[9]

                    His life and work can be summarized as follows:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nikola Tesla was born an ethnic Serb in the village of Smiljan, within the Military Frontier, in the Austrian Empire (present day Croatia), on 10 July [O.S. 28 June] 1856.His father, Milutin Tesla (1819 - 1879), was a priest of the Eastern Orthodox Church.</li>
                        <li>Tesla's mother, Đuka Mandić (1822 - 1892), whose father was also an Eastern Orthodox Church priest, had a talent for making home craft tools and mechanical appliances and the ability to memorize Serbian epic poems. Đuka had never received a formal education. Tesla credited his eidetic memory and creative abilities to his mother's genetics and influence.Tesla's ancestors were from western Serbia, near Montenegro.</li>
                        <li>Tesla was the fourth of five children. He had three sisters, Milka, Angelina, and Marica, and an older brother named Dane, who was killed in a horse riding accident when Tesla was aged five. In 1861, Tesla attended primary school in Smiljan where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion. In 1862, the Tesla family moved to the nearby Gospić, where Tesla's father worked as parish priest. Nikola completed primary school, followed by middle school. In 1870, Tesla moved to Karlovac[better source needed] to attend high school at the Higher Real Gymnasium where the classes were held in German, as it was usual throughout schools within the Austro-Hungarian Military Frontier</li>
                        <li>Tesla later wrote that he became interested in demonstrations of electricity by his physics professor. Tesla noted that these demonstrations of this "mysterious phenomena" made him want "to know more of this wonderful force". Tesla was able to perform integral calculus in his head, which prompted his teachers to believe that he was cheating.[28] He finished a four-year term in three years, graduating in 1873.</li>

                <h1>Controversy</h1>
                <h3>War of Currents</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the most significant controversies in Tesla's career was the "War of Currents" between alternating current (AC), advocated by Tesla and his supporter George Westinghouse, and direct current (DC), promoted by Thomas Edison. Edison went to great lengths to discredit AC, even publicly electrocuting animals to demonstrate its dangers, in an attempt to tarnish Tesla and Westinghouse's reputation.
                </p>
                <h3> Tesla's Unbuilt Inventions</h3>
                <p>
                    Tesla had numerous ideas and designs that were never built or realized. One of the most famous examples is the Wardenclyffe Tower, intended for wireless transmission of energy and communication. The tower was never completed, and Tesla faced financial difficulties that prevented him from realizing many of his ambitious projects.
                </p>
                <h3>Tesla and Marconi's Radio Patent Dispute</h3>
                <p>
                    
                    Tesla and Guglielmo Marconi were involved in a patent dispute over the invention of radio. Tesla claimed that Marconi's patents infringed on his own earlier work in wireless communication. The U.S. Supreme Court eventually upheld Tesla's patent, recognizing his contributions to the development of radio.

                <h1>Curiosities</h1>
                <h3>Tesla's Personal Habits and Obsessions:</h3>
                <p>                    
                    Tesla was known for his peculiar habits and phobias. He had an aversion to germs and would often wash his hands multiple times. Additionally, he was fascinated with the number three and multiples of three, and he often engaged in numerology and unusual rituals.
                </p>
                <h3>Death Ray Speculations:</h3>
                <p>                    
                    In his later years, Tesla claimed to have developed a "teleforce" weapon, often referred to as a "death ray." He described it as a defensive weapon that could shoot down aircraft and destroy armies. The specifics of this invention remain unclear, and some consider it to be more of a speculative idea than a realized invention.
